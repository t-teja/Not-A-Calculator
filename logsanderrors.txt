9 issues were found when checking AAR metadata:

  1.  Dependency 'androidx.constraintlayout:constraintlayout:2.2.1' requires libraries and applications that
      depend on it to compile against version 34 or later of the
      Android APIs.

      :app is currently compiled against android-33.

      Recommended action: Update this project to use a newer compileSdk
      of at least 34, for example 34.

      Note that updating a library or application's compileSdk (which
      allows newer APIs to be used) can be done separately from updating
      targetSdk (which opts the app in to new runtime behavior) and
      minSdk (which determines which devices the app can be installed
      on).

  2.  Dependency 'androidx.appcompat:appcompat-resources:1.7.0' requires libraries and applications that
