# NotACalculator 🧮😄

A fun prank calculator app that looks exactly like Android's stock calculator but gives hilariously wrong results! Perfect for pranking friends and family.

## 🎯 What It Does

This calculator appears completely legitimate and functions normally for input, but when you press equals, it gives amusing incorrect results instead of the correct answer.

### Examples:
- `2 + 2 = 5` (instead of 4)
- `10 × 3 = 60` (instead of 30) 
- `100 - 50 = 48` (instead of 50)
- `20 ÷ 4 = 6` (instead of 5)

4. **Operand swapping**: Swap the order of operations
